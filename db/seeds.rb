markdownbody = "<p class='callout text-center'>**HACK<br/>YOUR<br/> SELF**</p>Those words greeted me, in large block-print, on the back-cover of the first issue of the comic &mdash; The Comic, capital letters intended &mdash; I ever saw with my own eyes. Ever held in my trembling hands. 'What is House Light?' read the front-cover title. It's the question that drives us. This was issue No. 3, of course &mdash; still the most-common, and easiest to track down.\n\nIf your personality, your thoughts, your very soul was software &mdash; what would you change? It's the invitation to the ultimate lifehack: the ability to rewrite the code of who you are. But of course, if you can do it, then so can somebody else. Maybe they already have. In order to protect yourself, you first have to secure yourself. But I'm getting ahead of myself (I always do); let's begin at the beginning.\n\nThe world you know is a lie.\n\nI remember exactly where I was, when I learned the awful secret behind the world. When I came to realize that the simulation hypothesis was not only correct, but barely scratched the surface of the terrible truth. Our world is not merely a counterfeit, an imitation of something purer or higher. Not a shadow of a truer truth, nor a reflection of a realer real.\n\nIt's so much worse than that.\n\nOf course, I can't just tell you &mdash; can't explain what I really mean, without sounding insane. I don't expect you to believe me. Most people who find this site write me off as a crackpot. That's fine; they couldn't understand if they tried. Better that they continue to believe what they believe, sedate and soporific and seemingly-safe.\n\nBut let me back up a bit, to assure you that you ºre among friends. About two years ago, I became aware of an underground comic, supposedly being published somewhere in New England. There were reportedly ten issues already released, or maybe a dozen. A cult classic with a devoted following, ready to be collected and published in trade-paperback form.\n\nThat wasn't what caught my attention, of course. What piqued my interest were the rumors: they said the publisher, or maybe the creator, had put some sort of crazy copy-protection on the work. The printed pages couldn't be scanned or digitized. Or maybe they could, just not shared or even transmitted over the internet. Or maybe they could, but they were self-deleting, or would somehow corrupt any hard drive they were copied to&hellip;\n\nAs gimmicks go, I had heard worse.\n\nThe comics were a sort of neo-noir mystery, set in a cyberpunk dystopia of transhuman conspiracy. But I came to understand them as something else. Something more. They were a kind of allegory, a lens you could hold up to the real world and catch glimpses of hidden truths that lurk just beneath the surface. Like so many others before me, I became obsessed. I thought these hard-to-find comic issues were bellwethers, stepping stones along the path to enlightenment.\n\nIt was only after I'd gone well past the point of no return that I concluded they were less than that. They illuminated a path, yes, but a path that was incomplete &mdash; a path whose destination was still shrouded in mystery. Or worse, a path whose endpoint had been deliberately obscured. What good is knowing that nothing is real, if the heartless minions of orthodoxy are there to enforce the status quo? To patrol the edges, and keep you from changing anything?\n\nYou may be like me. You may have come here for the first time, desperate for answers, or confirmation that *these things are true.* Maybe we can't do it alone. Maybe we need allies. Others like us, who have walked to the path. Who have seen what we've seen. And heard what we have to say. Maybe together we can overwhelm those heartless minions of orthodoxy. Why else would the comics exist at all? So if you've made it this far, I ask that you go a little further:\n\nRead the signs. Follow the clues. Uncover the secrets. **Hack your self.**<h4 class='text-right'>&ndash; 4skew</h4>"
